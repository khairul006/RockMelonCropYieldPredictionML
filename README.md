# RockMelonCropYieldPredictionML
This project marks the final stage of my bachelor's degree. It uses a supervised machine learning algorithm to examine the characteristics of rock melon plants gathered from farmers. By analyzing this data, the goal is to predict the number of rock melon fruits that can potentially be harvested from each plant.
